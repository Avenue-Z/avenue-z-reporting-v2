# Pending Migrations

Schema changes that have been removed from application code but not yet
applied to the database.

## Drop `users.demo_mode` column

The demo-mode toggle was removed in `feat/remove-demo-mode` (2026-06-25). The
`demoMode` field was removed from `lib/db/schema.ts`, but the `demo_mode`
column is still present in the database. Generate and run a Drizzle migration
to drop it:

    npm run db:generate   # produces the DROP COLUMN migration
    npm run db:migrate
