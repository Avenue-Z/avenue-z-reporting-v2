# Pending Migrations

Schema changes that have been removed from application code but not yet
applied to the database.

## Drop `users.demo_mode` column

The demo-mode toggle was removed in `feat/remove-demo-mode` (2026-06-25). The
`demoMode` field was removed from `lib/db/schema.ts`, but the `demo_mode`
column is still present in the database. Generate and run a Drizzle migration
to drop it:

    npm run db:generate   # produces the DROP COLUMN migration
    npm run db:migrate

## Add client access columns (delivered, awaiting apply)

`drizzle/0011_*.sql` adds `clients.shared_password_hash` and
`clients.max_seats` (additive). Delivered on `repo-admin-panel`; apply per
`docs/runbooks/2026-06-25-admin-panel-launch.md`. The `users.demo_mode` drop
above is intentionally still separate and unapplied.
